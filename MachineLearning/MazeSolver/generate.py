Maze Generation and Solving

Here we will generate and solve mazes. Mazes are generated as png images
using the Python Imaging Library (PIL), and similarly solved by reading in
a png image, and outputing a new one with the solution marked out in green.

*Note*************************************************************************
All coordinates of our maze are initialized as "0" to signify "Black". As
a new coordinate enters the positions stack, it will be come "1" to signify
"White".
******************************************************************************

*METHOD***********************************************************************
Visualization:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Depth-First_Search_Animation.ogv

The approach taken in this lab is to use a "Depth First Search" approach at
maze generation and solving. This method starts with a "stack", let's call
this stack "positions". It will be initialized at some coordinate to signify
the start of the maze. As such, we may begin at:

    positions = [
        (0, 0)
    ]

We then will look for a valid position to take, and randomly select it.  Two
possibilities now exist:

    1. We take a random step.
    2. No valid options exist.

If (1), then we simply append the new coordinate to the positions stack,
adjust variables accordingly, and continue. If (2), then we "pop" the last
position out of the stack, and continue from where we previously were (seeking
out a new step to take). Note, this backtracking is represented in the
wikipedia example as the maze changing to blue.

Once the entire space of possible choices has been explored, it should be
evident that the backtracking will continue until the positions stack is
empty. It is at this point that the maze generation should end.

When solving, the same approach can be taken. Care needs to be made in
regards to assessing if a step is "valid" or not. Further, a new end criteria
needs making.
